                    <h2>Object Study</h2>
                        <p>For this task we had to take a mundane object we had in our bag and draw around it to create something interesting.
                        This task was a little challenging since my object was essentially just a line by itself, but I enjoyed drawing what I came
                        up with in the end. It helped me think more creatively about prop design and how you dont have to be confined to the typical
                        array of objects associated with a topic if theres no reason to not think outside the box.</p>

                <p>In this task we went outside to find a person we found interesting, drew them and created attributes for them. We had around 25 minuets
                to do this. I chose a middle aged man with a really interesting fluffy jacket with bright green and purple stripes.<br>After this we
                created our characters with plasticine and got in groups to create a simple storyboard with a story structure.</p>

                <p>For this story board I created a simple story using everyone's character who was in my group, it was a bit hard at first to think of
                something that made sense but eventually everything started clicking and it was fun. After that, Issabelle, one of my group members removed
                the background from the pictures we took of the plasticine and I edited them into the board to tell the story.</p>

                <img src="Images/storyboard nick 6.png" alt="A black and white storyboard of a man putting on gloves and going through a mirror" class="center">
                <p>For this task we were suppose to make a storyboard out of our favorite frames in the movie "." I had a lot of fun with this 
                project, it was challenging because of how much emphasis was on the hands but not so much in that it was frusterating. Since
                the film was in black and white it made it easier to add values and I really enjoyed doing that with the cross hatching instead
                of just selecting a color and filling in things solid, since the sketches were rough a lot of the linework wasnt connected so using 
                the fill tool would have been slower than cross hatching and I liked how it turned out even if I didnt get to add values to everything.</p>

                <p>for this task we were suppose to pick an object we had and draw it, then re-draw the drawing our neighbor drew of their object in order to animate them
                transitioning from one to another. Since we had no lightbox my animation sorta stays in the same plays or moves at odd times, but I really enjoyed
                the process of animating, at first it was hard to decide what order to draw the keyframes but I got the hang of it. I really liked thinking
                about what the combination of two frames would be, it was challenging enough to be fun but not enough to be frusterating.</p>
